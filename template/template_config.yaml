# Overview of the  model report
describe_overview: |
  The model analyzed in this card classifies EEG into abnormal or normal class and returns an uncertainty estimation of the
  predicted class with a confidence interval. It reports the model's hyperparameters and performance plots. The reader can gain further
  insights about the model's limitation by identifying the input instances where the model is expected to perform well.

learning_rate: 1e-05 # Learning rate used in training
batch_size: 32 # Batch size used in training
additional_info: 0.75 M parameters  # Additional information about the model


# Describing limitations about the model
limitation_details: 
  - The training dataset inherits class imbalance, with a male-to-female ratio of 3:1, which could potentially lead to fairness concerns.
  - Noisy channels, missing channels in the data will degrade the model's performance.

# Description about the model´s performance
performance_comments: 
  Here you can dig into the model's performance on a selection of evaluation datasets drawn from different data sources than the training data.
  
 

# Describe about the uncertanity of the model´s prediction.
uncertainty_describe: |
  Confidence intervals provide an additional perspective on the uncertainty surrounding the reported metrics
  and performance of the model.
